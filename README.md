# ✈️ Real-Time Flight Tracking & Analytics Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

A scalable real-time flight tracking and analytics platform built using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, AWS S3, AWS RDS MySQL, and Power BI.

The system continuously ingests live flight data from the OpenSky Network API, processes streaming events using Spark, stores cleaned and aggregated datasets in a cloud-based data lake, and delivers operational insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

The architecture is designed to simulate an enterprise-grade streaming data pipeline capable of handling thousands of concurrent flight updates with fault tolerance and scalability.

# 🎯 Business Problem

Air traffic generates massive volumes of continuously changing data including:

* Flight positions
* Altitude changes
* Velocity updates
* Origin countries
* Flight statuses

Traditional batch processing systems cannot provide timely insights for:

* Air traffic monitoring
* Operational analytics
* Flight density analysis
* Regional traffic trends

This project addresses the challenge by implementing a real-time streaming architecture capable of ingesting, processing, storing, and visualizing live flight information.

# 📥 Data Flow

## Step 1: Flight Data Collection

A Python producer continuously requests flight information from OpenSky Network.

Example record:

```json
{
  "icao24": "a1b2c3",
  "callsign": "AAL123",
  "origin_country": "United States",
  "longitude": -73.7781,
  "latitude": 40.6413,
  "altitude": 32000,
  "velocity": 245.5,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Step 2: Kafka Streaming

The producer publishes flight events to Kafka.

Topic:

```text
flights
```

Benefits:

* Decouples ingestion and processing
* Supports scalability
* Provides fault tolerance

---

## Step 3: Spark Structured Streaming

Spark consumes data from Kafka and performs:

### Data Validation

* Remove malformed records
* Handle missing values

### Data Transformation

* Cast data types
* Generate event timestamps
* Standardize fields

### Watermarking

```python
.withWatermark(
    "event_timestamp",
    "10 minutes"
)
```

Purpose:

* Handles late arriving events
* Prevents unbounded state growth

---

## Step 4: Window Aggregation

Example aggregation:

```python
.groupBy(
    window(
        col("event_timestamp"),
        "5 minutes"
    ),
    col("origin_country")
)
.agg(
    count("*").alias("flight_count")
)
```

Produces:

| Window      | Country | Flight Count |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 12:00-12:05 | USA     | 480          |
| 12:00-12:05 | India   | 220          |
| 12:00-12:05 | Germany | 190          |

---

## Step 5: Data Storage

### AWS S3

Stores:

```text
s3://flight-data-lake/clean/
```

Purpose:

* Historical analysis
* Backup storage
* Data lake architecture

### AWS RDS MySQL

Stores aggregated metrics for dashboard consumption.

Example table:

```sql
flight_metrics
```

| window_start |
| country |
| flight_count |

---
